# genRandSent
This a python program that uses n-grams taken from a txt file of "corporate bs" sentences to generate random sentences.

Allows the user to input the size of the n-gram and amount of sentences to generate. (The larger the n-gram, the more "natural-sounding" the sentence.)

This project was originally created for my Introduction to Natural Language Processing class at San Jose State University.
